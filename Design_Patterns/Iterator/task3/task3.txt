3.Imagine a media application that needs to process different types of playlists stored in various formats, such as arrays (for recently played songs), lists (for favorite songs), and trees (for categorized albums).
The media application expects to access songs sequentially through a specific interface, but each playlist format uses a completely different internal structure.
An iterator can bridge the gap between the media application and the diverse playlist formats by providing a consistent way to traverse through each collection, enabling seamless access to the songs without modifying the media application or the playlist structures.
Can you implement this scenario using the Iterator Pattern?
